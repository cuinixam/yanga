## Abstract

This proposal introduces **Poks**, a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS), user-space package manager for Yanga. Inspired by [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), Poks provides a uniform way to install and manage developer tools (compilers, SDKs, CLI utilities) using simple JSON manifests. It eliminates the need for OS-specific setup scripts and ensures deterministic build environments across different platforms.
